## Contributing

Contributions to the math.js library are very welcome! We can't do this alone.
You can contribute in different ways: spread the word, report bugs, come up with
ideas and suggestions, and contribute to the code.

There are a few preferences regarding code contributions:

- Math.js follows the node.js code style as described
  [here](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide).
- Make sure you properly unit test your changes.
- Before creating a pull request, run the unit tests to make sure they all pass.
- Only commit changes done in the source files under `lib`, not to the builds
  which are located in the folder `dist`.
- Send pull requests to the `develop` branch, not the `master` branch.

Thanks!
